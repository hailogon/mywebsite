		<h2>What's up?</h2>
		<p>
			Honestly, if you're seeing this then you're here a little early. Come back later for a website.
		</p>

		<h2>Can I email you?</h2>
		<p>
			Sure! Just please don't put my email address on any mailing lists. I only want emails that someone's written from scratch, you get me? If that's you, then catch me at "mail[at][thisdomain][dot]uk".
